/* layer 1: form -- display 
form: personal details, skills, employment, projects, education
display: "" "" "" "" ""
form components: input (they can all be text/textarea inputs to make typing styles more flexible)
form header: name, job title, profile statement, links:  (email, phone, location, github, (optional: personal website, discord))
form skills: skill category (e.g 'Javascript), skill selection (e.g. 'OOP', 'ES6')
form professional experience: role, company, dates (from & to), location, job description
form courses: course name, organisation, description
form education: qualification, university/school, location, dates, description
Display components: main sections for header, skills, proffesional, courses & education
header will be compulsory but the other 4 can render conditionally since they will depend on a stateful array
(so if there are no skills entered that section will not render)*/
